## Specialness of Financial Intermediaries
- Banks play a key role in the financial arena
  - brokerage function: between households and corporations
  - asset transformation: deposits to securities investments
  - maturity transformation: short-term deposits and diversifying investments
  - reeucing liquidity and price risk: offering deposits and diversifying investments
  - reducing information costs: monitoring agents (corporates) to act properly
  - Conduits of: monetary policy, credit allocation, payment services
- Don't forget negative externalities though: economic consequences of problematic or failing banks.

## What is ALM?
- Risk management of financial intermediaries
- RMFI embraces a multi-dimensional plan
  - Policy setting
  - Hedging positions
  - Financing decisions
  - Capital budgeting decisions
  - Determining maturity plans
  - Structuring repricing intervals
  - Internal profitability measures
    - ALM is also contingency planning
      - Impact of unexpected changes on FI
        - interest rates, exchange rates, competition, growth, etc.
      - Responses to those changes
    - Managing the sources and uses of funds in a financial intermediary
      - avoid mismatching of assets and liabilities
      - protect against liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange risks, etc.
  - The "maximize profits - minimize risk" illusion
    - basic rule in finance: there is no such thing as a free lunch
  - ALM is the understanding of different risk-return tradeoffs -- it is a multidimensional set of activities.
  - Asset-Liability management$
    - Policy and hedging strategies
    - Understand balance sheet constraints
    - Measuring and monitoring risks

## ALM Evolution
The discipline of ALM has gone through enormous changes since its inception in the early 1970s. During that time, and in subsequent years, ALM began slowly to bypass the dominance of the accounting perception and cashflow matching and started instituting the use of advanced analytical techniques, quantitative finance tools as well as sophisticated pricing formulas and hedging strategies.

## Simplified Management Structure
| Chief Risk Officer | Treasury | Chief Financial Officer |
|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Risk management** | **Assetâ€“liability management** | **Finance** |
| Limit framework and setting | Strategy and planning | Accounting |
| Market risk | Liquidity risk management | Budget setting |
| Credit risk | Interest rate risk management | Forecasting |
| Operational risk | Hedging policy | Strategy and planning |
| Monitoring and control | Balance sheet management | Product control |
| Management information reporting | Internal funds pricing policy | Valuation and MtM |
| Compliance monitoring | Liquidity stress-testing | Financial reporting |
| Stress-testing policy | Capital management | NIM management |
| ERM | ALCO reporting | |

## Risk/Return Tradeoff
The ALM is an optimization of our investments, choosing a tradeoff between risk and return, which in turn depends on the level of risk aversion, which in turn is also determined by exogenous factors such as size and market conditions, say. 

## The Goal of ALM
- Maximize risk adjusted returns over the long run
  - positive correlation between expected profitability and overall risk structure.
- Maximize value of the firm
  - Thereby maximizing shareholder value
- Long-run targets:
  - A period where growth can be maintained, i.e. sustainable growth.
  - Markets do not react favorably if performance cannot be sustained.

## The ALM Process
- Establishment of policies and guidelines
- Analysis (risks, forecasts, limits, etc.)
- Decision-making
- Execution
- Evaluation
- Financial analysis tells us where we have been
- Capital budgeting tells us where we want to go
- ALM tells us how we are going to get there.

## Corporate Management Theories
- Normative approach
  - classical theory focusing on how managers should act
    - decisions provide net benefits to owners
    - owners set the ALM objectives
- Positive approach
  - given the managers' actions, what does it tell us about ALM?
    - in other words, how decisions are made
  - Aiming to explain the behavior of managers arising from the separation of ownership and control, i.e. Agency Theory

## Banking Behavior Theories
Studying the banking literature, one comes across two main schools of thought:
- hedging hypothesis
  - objective: immunize the bank's balance sheet against changes in interest rates
- micro-aspect view
  - objective: maximization of a utility function -- wealth.

## Financial Institution Spread & ALM
- Largest expenses of FI are the interest cost of liabilities
- Spread (Net Interest Income)
  - Interest on assets less the cost of liabilites
- ALM is all about control of the net interest margin.

$$\text{NIM} = \frac{\text{interest on assets} - \text{cost of liabilities}}{\text{assets}} = \frac{NII}{assets}$$
- A modified NIM to reflect the nature of the insurer.
$$\text{Net underwriting margin} = \frac{\text{premium income} - \text{policy expenses}}{\text{assets}}$$

Generally ALM requires:
- setting risk/return objectives
  - Setting the level of NIM must be compatible
- Knowledge of financial markets
  - Factors affecting interest rates
  - impact of interest rates on NIM
  - FX, credit, liquidity etc
- Simultaneous decisions about
  - Types of assets-liabilities
  - Quantity of assets-liabilities
  - Mixture of assets-liabilities

## Risks of Financial Intermediaries
- Credit risk
- Market risk
- Trading risk
- FX risk
- Liquidity risk
- Sovereign risk
- Interest rate risk
- Off-balance sheet risk
- Technology/operational risk
- Managing these risks is central to FI performance.

### Interest Rate Risk
- IRR has three dimensions
- Assume financing costs 7%, investment return 8.5%
- Exploit spread by borrowing short-term and lending long-term, i.e. 150bp profit.

### Refinancing Risk
- What happens in the second year?
- What if borrowing rates increase to 10% -- 150bp loss!
- Refinancing risk is when the assets' maturity is greater than the liabilities' maturity.
- The risk that the cost of rolling over or reborrowing funds will rise above the return on assets.
- During the 1980s, a classic example of such a mismatch were the US thrifts (savings banks).

### Reinvestment Risk
- The second dimension of IRR
- Assume financing coss of 7% and investment return of 8.5%
- What happens when the investment matures?
- Obviously funds cannot be kept in a safe box
  - new investments take place
- What if ROA falls to 5.5% -- leads to a 150bp loss.
- Reinvestment risk is when the assets' maturity is less than the liabilities' maturity.
- The risk that the return on funds to be reinvested will fall below the financing cost
- During the 1980s, classic example of such exposure was the US banks operating in the Euromarket by borrowing fixed while investing in floating rates.

### Market Value Risk
- Value of assets/liabilities = discounted expected cashflow
- if interest rates rise, present values fall and vice versa.
- If assets' maturity is greater than liabilities' maturity and interest rates rise, then assets' value will fall more than liabilities' value falls.
- Market value risk the effect of a change in interest rates on the market value of A/L changes.
- The risk that asset-liabilities' values will fall/rise with an unexpected increase/decrease in interest rates.

#### IRR Concept
Q: Does maturity matching effectively hedge against IRR?
A: Not really. Don't forget the concept of duration!
FI fund assets with equity and debt. It's the debt's duration (in relation to assets) that is important.

Matching maturities works against the active asset transformation function of financial intermediaries. This may reduce profitability, since returns from acting as specialized risk-bearing asset transformer are eliminated.

### Trading Risk
- Assets/liabilities may not be held for long-term investment, funding, or hedging purposes
- FI actively trade assets/liabilities
  - Loans, mortgages, securitization, bonds
- Feb. 1995 Bearings
  - $1.3b losses in futures markets
  - When losses are greater than equity capital this means insolvency.
- Trading risk is present whenever a FI takes long/short positions in different trades.

### Credit Risk
- FI invest in other corporations
- Government securities -- no problem
- other borrowers -- possibility of default
- claims held by FI -- interest + principal
- on default of FI
  - earns zero interest on assets
  - may lose all or part of the principal
  - access borrower's assets through insolvency procedures.
- Actions taken by FI
  - demand risk premiums = risk exposure
  - close monitoring of their borrowers
  - portfolio selection and its effect on asset allocation
  - balancing systematic vs idiosyncratic risk
- Systematic credit risk: the risk of default associated with general market-wide conditions affecting all borrowers.
- Firm-specific credit risk: the risk of default associated with the specific conditions attributed to a single borrower.

### Off-Balance Sheet Risk
- Off-balance sheet items -- part of FI global operations
  - they can certainly backfire!
- Letters of credit: guarantee payments of municipal bonds
  - if municipality is financially strong, FI gets the fee for issuing LC
  - if municipality defaults LC becomes the actual liability
- Contro over off-balance sheet item
- update information for borrowers
- other off-balance sheet items
  - derivatives, pass-through securities, CMOs, etc.

### Technological/Operational Risk
- Prior to 1975: paper-based transactions, meaning if volume increased, efficiency decreased
- Rapid development of technology during the 1980s and 1990s
  - electronic trading
  - advances in IT, rapid access to information
  - Citi: connected to more than 80 countries via satellite.
- Objectives of technological expansion
  - increase profits
  - capture new markets
  - reduce operational costs
  - increase efficiency and effectiveness.

Economies of scale: lower average operational cost by expanding financial services.
Economies of scope: cost synergies by using one input and producing many outputs, for example sell both loan and insurance products.

Operational - Technology cost
- Hi-Tech does not always produce the anticipated cost-savings
  - Disruptions
  - low performance
  - service quality
  - increase expenses
- IT breaks down
- What about unauthorized trading, what kind of risk is that? (Operational!)

### FOREX Risk
- FI invest huge amounts in international forex markets.
- FI benefit from FDI and foreign portfolio investment.
- US pension funds: 10% of their assets in foreign securities
- Japanese pension funds: >30% of their assets in foreign securities and 10% in FC deposits.
- As a general rule
  - if the FI is net short in the foreign currency, they have a negative net exposure to interest rates, meaning the risk is if the foreign currency appreciates
  - if the FI is net long in the foreign currency, they have a positive net exposure to interest rates, meaning the risk is if the foreign currency depreciates.
- By matching both size and maturity, the FI is immunized against FX and IR risk.

### Sovereign Risk
- Sovereign risk could be a serious form of credit risk
- Foreign corporation may be unable to repay a loan
- Government may prohibit/limit repayments
  - Corruption
  - political reason
  - currency inconvertibility
  - bureaucracy
  - attitude of public
  - blockage of fund transfers
  - attitude of host government
- Precautions taken
  - country risk analysis
  - control supply of funds
  - what if a country or currency collapses? Bad luck?

### Liquidity Risk
- Inability to meet liabilities
  - unexpected cash withdrawals
  - unexpected claims from insurance policyholders
- 3D aspect of liquidity
  - most liquid asset is cash, but try to minimize FI can sell part of their securities, but they may not be easily liquidated
  - FI can sell part of their fixed assets (less liquid)
  - FI can borrow extra cash

Q: What if, there is no time for negotiating selling or borrowing conditions
A: Highly possible that the deal will not be profitable. This may result in serious liquidity problems. Possibly insolvency.

Actions taken:
- Good horizon planning
- Strategic asset allocation
- Qualified research analysts
- Emergency procedure actions

### Insolvency Risk
- The result of the aforementioned types of risk
  - Inappropriate handling of risks
  - Excessive market conditions (exogenous and unavoidable)
- High leverage may imply high risk? Not necessarily.
- Capital adequacy: key aspect to remain solvent and grow
- Insolvency risk: inadequate internal capital resources to meet losses.

## Risks' Interdependence
- FI tradeoff among various risks
  - foreign exchange and interest rates
  - interest rates and credit risk
  - foreign exchange and country risk
  - high unemployment
- Other risks
  - Turbulent market conditions
    - War, revolution, boycott, taxation changes, etc.
    - Interest rate volatility: 1997-98/liquidity problems.
    - 2007 credit crunch.

## ALM & IRR Exposure
### Overview of an integrated financial policy
- NIM reflects ALM decisions
- The numerator accoutns for both yields/costs
- What if financing and investment decisions are separated
  - Targeted NIM + RONW cannot be achieved!
- Institutional risks - asset yields - liability costs
  - this is an important triangle -- DO NOT IGNORE IT!
  - Aggressive liability strategy means investments with acceptable level of risk.
  - high cost of funds means credit risk!
- Maturity mismatches can also undermine NIM + RONW
  - US interest rate volatility of 1979-82
- Matching assets and liabilities to avoid liquidity problems
  - assets provide cash to retire liabilities
- Strategies that FI may consider
  - balance sheet restructuring
  - off-balance sheet hedging

## Measuring IRR Exposure
Two ways to evaluate IRR exposure
- IR effect on future cashflows
  - Inflows/outflows, NII, earnings, etc.
  - Refinancing/reinvestment risk
- IR effect on the market value of equity
  - duration mismatches affect MKT values
    - long duration means more exposure.

## GAP Analysis
$$GAP = RSA - RSL$$
- RSA (RSL) = repriced at maturity or reset periodically prior to maturity
  - short-term assets/liabilities
  - long-term floating rate instruments
- GAP = mismatched amount of assets and liabilities
- Positive GAP: RSA > RSL (essentially measures the amount of RSA financed by FRL)
- Negative GAP = RSA < RSL (essentially measures the amount of FRA financed by RSL)
- Another way of comparing RSA & RSL is the GAP ratio
  - GAP ratio = RSA / RSL
- GAP ratio permits cross-sectional comparisons allowing for differences in size.
- Q: What does a GAP ratio of 1.69 and 0.69 indicate?
- A: For every $1 of RSL the Fi has $1.69 of RSA (positive gap)
     For every $1 of RSL the FI has $0.69 of RSA (negative gap)
- Most banks generally run negative GAPs

## Multi-Period GAP
- Evaluation and management of GAP depends on the planning period.
- Difficulties in identifying a single planning period, then calculating
  - several periodic GAPs
  - a cumulative GAP
- FRA & FRL are considered fixed over the GAP interval.
